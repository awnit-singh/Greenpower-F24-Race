# Greenpower-F24-Race

Greenpower is an IET F24+ racing competition for 16-24 year olds testing speed and endurance in a 90 minute race. The competition has requirements on the size of the vehicle, the specific batteries and motor used, and other safety requirements without which the EV would be disqualified to race.
I led a team of 12 students to design and this build electric vehicle. I also designed and assembled the circuitry, implementing the wiring such that it did not disturb the driver during the race. I also programmed an Arduino sensor to provide real time temperature data so that we could diagnose if heat is a limiting factor for the efficiency of the EV and implemented a heating solution using directed airflow and heatsyncs onto the motor.
